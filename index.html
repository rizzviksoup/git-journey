    <h1>Hi Akshu 💗</h1>

    <p class="text">
      Hi Akshu I know everything’s okay between us, but I just wanted to make this
      because you mean a lot to me. I really love you and everything about you.
      I can talk to you for hours and not get bored, talking to you is therapeutic for me.
      You and your interesting stories make my day better and you make me smile
      even when I don’t feel like smiling. I’m really sorry I made you cry...and
      pinky promise next time ill try my best to not upset you and make you cry, but if I ever do make u cry again you can hit me how many evertimes you want to. Thank you for making my day better just by being in it.
    </p>
